This repo contains a series of notebooks in which I explore the application of machine learning tools to a variety of astronomical databases. 

1. Regression models - applied to SDSS data to estimate redshift from photometric magnitudes
2. Classification models - applied to Kepler Objects of Interest (KOI) data to identify likely exoplanet candidates
3. Clustering models - applied to subset of Gaia DR2 to identify open clusters in the Milky Way

Accompanying written reports are also provided for notebooks 2 and 3, prepared as coursework for the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate.
